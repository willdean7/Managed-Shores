CoSMoS Sensitivity Analysis Summary
========================================
Site: carpinteria
Date: 2025-11-15
Scenarios tested: 13
SLR projections: Intermediate, Intermediate_High, High

COMPARISON: % IMMEDIATE RETREAT (≤10 years)
(Intermediate SLR scenario)

  BASELINE (Redfin rents): 59.1%

  5% Rental Yield: 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  4% Rental Yield: 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  6% Rental Yield: 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Tiered Yields (6% <$1M, 5% $1-3M, 4% $3-10M, 3% >$10M): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Hybrid (Redfin if 2-8% yield, else 5%): 12.7% (↓46.4% vs baseline)
  Patient Discount (2% = β=0.98): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Very Patient Discount (1% = β=0.99): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Ignore Minor Flooding (<15cm): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Only Major Flooding (>50cm): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Owner Utility +$50K/year: 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Owner Utility +$100K/year: 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)
  Optimistic (6% yield, β=0.99, +$50K utility, >50cm threshold): 0.0% (↓59.1% vs baseline)


RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Baseline uses actual Redfin rental data (may underestimate for luxury properties)
  2. Consider 5% fixed yield as more realistic alternative
  3. Patient discount rate (β=0.98-0.99) appropriate for government planning
  4. Damage threshold (15-50cm) accounts for nuisance flooding tolerance
  5. Owner utility premium reflects non-financial coastal living value
